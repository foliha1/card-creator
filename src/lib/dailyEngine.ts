// ============================================================================
// dailyEngine — the daily puzzle's own tiny state machine.
//
// The daily is NOT a game of Whoop Whoop: it is one recall test with three
// rule changes. There is no draw pile, no refills, no re-rolls, no bot.
//
// Sequence (see DailyPhase):
//   READY    static start gate; nothing runs until START
//   DEAL     nine cards deal face down (3×3)
//   STUDY    all nine flip face up and hold for STUDY_MS with a countdown
//   HIDE     all nine flip back face down
//   ROLL     the die rolls for the current round (clock paused)
//   PLAY     player taps two cards; the second tap locks the claim (one peek per run)
//   WHOOPED  the round ran out of misses: it ends with the board untouched
//   DONE     all three rounds played out
//
// Misses are capped PER ROUND (MISSES_PER_ROUND). A wrong pair spends one of
// the round's two misses and play continues in that round. The second miss
// Whoops the round: nothing is revealed and nothing leaves the board — the
// round simply ends and the next one rolls. Only a solve shrinks the board, so
// a clean run plays 9 → 7 → 5 while a failed round keeps its cards in play.
// The run never ends early — every player plays all three rounds.
//
// All three die rolls are drawn from the daily seed at init time and validated
// so that every reachable board still holds a pair for that round's rule.
